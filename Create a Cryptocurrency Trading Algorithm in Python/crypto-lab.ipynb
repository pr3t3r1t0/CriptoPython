The currencies you are familar with and likely use on a day-to-day basis, such as the US Dollar and the Euro, are known as _fiat currencies_. They are issued by the government and there exists a central authority, such as a central bank, to regulate and govern it's use. In stark contrast, a defining feature of a _Cryptocurrency_ is that there is no central regulatory authority. Instead, transactions are held in a ledger or database which is secured cryptographically. Both types of currencies have their advantages and disadvantages.\n","\n","While this is all interesting, the most important question you might be asking is \"what's in it for me?\" As an individual investor, you may find success in trading Cryptocurrencies to take home a profit - but unfortunately, that often involves a significant time investment, tracking charts and prices to determine what the next trade to make is.

As you're likely well aware, the general principle is to buy an asset at a low price, then sell it at a higher price and pocket the difference. The tricky part is that unless you can see the future (in which case, call us), it's not easy to know which direction the price will move after you buy it. Fortunately, we can try to improve our chances of making a good trade beyond blind luck by sticking to a trading strategy. A great number of trading strategies exist with varying levels of complexity so let's take a look at just one of them for now.\n","\n","\u003cbr\u003e\n","\n","One of the simplest trading strategies making use of Simple Moving Averages is the [***Moving Average Crossover***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_crossover?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\u0026utm_source=Exinfluencer\u0026utm_content=000026UJ\u0026utm_term=10006555\u0026utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsanalyzecryptomarketswiththecoinbaseapi457-2023-01-01). The basic idea behind this strategy is to use two Simple Moving Averages - one with a relatively short sampling interval and the other with a longer interval. When the shorter moving average crosses over the longer interval moving average, it can signal a reversal in trend. For example, if the shorter term moving average is below the longer moving average but then crosses over to the top of it, this may signal the beginning of an upwards (bullish) trend. Using the _Moving Average Crossover_ strategy, this would be a _buy_ signal. Similarily, when the shorter moving average is above the longer interval one and it crosses under, this could signal a downward (bearish) trend, which would be a _sell_ signal in this strategy.`\n","\n","\u003cbr\u003e\n","\n","The simplicity of this approach makes it an excellent first strategy to implement.

This is great information but we're not quite yet done. We're interested in determining at what point we should actually buy and sell our Bitcoin.\n","\n","According to our _Moving Average Crossover_ strategy, we want to buy when the short-term SMA crosses the long-term SMA from below, and sell when it crosses over from above. We can easily use the `Signal` column in the `trade_signals` dataframe to determine where exactly these events occur. If the `Signal` column has value 0.0 on a given date then switches to 1.0, this means the short-term SMA crossed the long-term SMA from _below_ - this is our time to **buy** Bitcoin according to our strategy. On the other hand, if the value goes from 1.0 to 0.0, that tells us the short-term SMA was _above_ the long-term SMA and then crossed over - this is our time to **sell**.\n","\n","Let's create a new column in the dataframe called `Positions`, where for each date in the dataframe it will tell the algorithm which action to take. A value of 1.0 will represent a _buy_ order, a -1.0 will be a _sell_ order, and a value of 0.0 will tell the algorithm to take no action. To compute these values from the `Signal` column, the `diff()` method from the pandas library will prove extraordinarily useful.

Suppose the short-term SMA is below the long-term SMA. Then for that period, the `Signal` column will have the value 0. Then suppose we have a crossing, such that the short-term SMA now moves above the long-term one. Then the `Signal` column will now have value 1.0 and so the `diff()` method will compute the difference between the `Signal` value that day and the one before, i.e., $1 - 0 = 1$, thus giving us a `Positions` value of 1 for that day (i.e., a **buy** order). The opposite scenario occurs when the short-term SMA crosses back underneath the long-term SMA. the `diff()` method assigns a value of $0 - 1 = -1$ to the `Position` column on the day of the crossing (i.e., a **sell** order). On the days where there is no crossing, each consecutive day has the same value in the `Signal` column, so the `diff()` method assigns a value of 0 to the `Position` column.\n","\n","\u003cbr\u003e\n","\n","Phew!

Often, the first way to do this is to perform a [**backtest**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\u0026utm_source=Exinfluencer\u0026utm_content=000026UJ\u0026utm_term=10006555\u0026utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsanalyzecryptomarketswiththecoinbaseapi457-2023-01-01). The core idea behind a backtest is to simulate running your trading algorithm on historical data and compute several metrics, such as the return. While this method certainly _does not_ guarantee that the algorithmn will be consistently profitable, it's a quick way to test the viability of a strategy and reject clearly unfeasable strategies.\n","\n","Let's do a simple backtest over the 2020 BTC-USD data on the trading algorithm we implemented. There are many libraries that can perform sophisticated backtests on a variety of algorithms, however, to develop an understanding of the underlying principle, let's implement our own simple backtest. Let's suppose we start with an account with $10,000 USD.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Define how much money you will start with (in USD)\n","initial_balance = 10000.0 # ten thousand USD\n","\n","# Create dataframe containing all the dates considered\n","backtest = pd.DataFrame(index=trade_signals.index)\n","\n","# Add column containing the daily percent returns of Bitcoin\n","backtest['BTC_Return'] = BTC_USD['Close'] / BTC_USD['Close'].shift(1) # Current closing price / yesterday's closing price\n"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now to compute the daily returns of the trading algorithm, let's assume that at any given point, our portfolio is either all in on Bitcoin or is entirely holding USD.

On the other hand, when the algorithm is holding USD, its returns are entirely detached from Bitcoin price movements. Thus when holding USD, the value of the portfolio remains constant during that period. We will also make the simplifying assumption that we are able to perform zero comission trades.

In the plot you can clearly see the periods in which the algorithm was all in on Bitcoin and the periods where it was holding USD.

In particular, with strategies that have tunable parameters, such as the periods of the Simple Moving Averages in our algorithm, it can be tempting to fine tune them to produce the best results on the historical data. You must be careful in doing this as it can result in the algorithm being overfit to the historical data and may not generalize well to future data. This might lead to an unpleasant suprise where the algorithm that you were so confident in based on past data ends up performing horribly on real-time data and trades. No one likes lost money and a bruised ego so once you have an algorithm that you have backtested and found to be viable, it is generally a good idea to forward test it as well.\n","\n","Forward testing allows you to test your algorithm with real time data and simulate how it would perform in real conditions. You deploy your trading algorithm for real, only you give it fake money to play with. That way if things go horribly wrong, you haven't risked your hard earned cash. If things go well, this may give you more confidence that your algorithm works well and you can feel better about eventually putting real money into it.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Next Steps**\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Great work!
